# Verbalization2
Cre/**
* PART 1: 
* Write a function `f(a, b)` which takes two strings as arguments and returns a
* string containing the characters found in both strings (without duplication), in the
* order that they appeared in `a`. Remember to skip spaces and characters you
* have already encountered!
*
* Example: commonCharacters('acexivou', 'aegihobu')
* Returns: 'aeiou'
*
* PART 2:
* Extend your function to handle more than two input strings.
* 
* 1. TODO: Determine I.O.C.E.
*   I:
*   O:
*   C:
*   E:
*
* 2. TODO: Pseudocode you entire solution
